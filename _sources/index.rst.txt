Hardware Emulations using 5G Toolkit and SDRs: Hands-on
========================================================
.. include:: <isonum.txt>

Welcome to **Hardware Emulations using 5G Toolkit and SDRs (GW:H5GSDR)**! This course serves as an introduction to 5G
standards utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs). Its objective is to offer hands-on experience in 5G system design
and 5G-NR 3GPP standards using the `5G Toolkit <https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/>`_ and software-defined
radios.

5G Toolkit
***********
`5G Toolkit <https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/>`_ provides a rich library of functions and modules in Python
based on NumPy to design algorithms for 5G and Beyond wireless systems. It implements 3GPP standards complaint downlink
and uplink chains to perform multi-cell link level and system level simulations. It support variety of realistic antenna
models, simulation models and channels to facilitates the users to carry out standards-based research, development and
testing. It provides modules which are highly optimized for performance to reduce the prototyping time which further
scales with GPUs and TPUs.

Learning wireless communication and 5G using SDRs provides a practical, cost-effective, and versatile approach that
empowers learners to gain valuable skills and insights in the field of wireless networking and communication and offers
several benefits:

| **Hands-on Experience:** SDRs provide a practical platform for experimenting with real-world wireless communication scenarios. This hands-on experience enhances understanding and retention of theoretical concepts.
| **Flexibility:** SDRs can be programmed and reconfigured to emulate different wireless standards, making them versatile tools for exploring various communication protocols and techniques.
| **Cost-effectiveness:** Compared to traditional hardware-based radio equipment, SDRs are often more affordable, allowing for wider accessibility and experimentation without significant financial investment.
| **Real-world Application:** By working with SDRs, learners gain insights into the practical challenges and considerations involved in implementing wireless communication systems, preparing them for real-world applications in industry.
| **Rapid Prototyping:** SDRs enable rapid prototyping and development of new wireless communication algorithms and systems, accelerating the innovation cycle in the field.
| **Integration with Software Tools:** SDRs can be integrated with software tools and libraries, such as Python-based frameworks, facilitating seamless integration of signal processing algorithms and simulation environments.
| **Understanding Limitations:** Through experimentation with SDRs, learners gain an appreciation for the limitations and constraints of wireless communication systems, leading to more informed design decisions.
| **Preparation for Emerging Technologies:** SDRs can be used to explore emerging technologies beyond 5G, such as millimeter-wave communication, massive MIMO, and dynamic spectrum access, allowing learners to stay at the forefront of technological advancements.
