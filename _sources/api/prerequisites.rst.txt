Pre-requisites
==================


The course assumes that the audience has only a basic understanding of wireless communication fundamentals and a
rudimentary grasp of 3GPP 5G-NR standards. However, participants will benefit most from the course and be able to fully
engage with it if they are proficient in Python and have access to a Software Defined Radio (SDR) for hands-on
experiments. The course leverages pertinent wireless algorithms and 5G modules from the `5G Toolkit <https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/>`_
developed by Gigayasa. The `5G Toolkit <https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/>`_ is a Python-based library-package designed for simulating 5G and Beyond networks.

**Must haves: Pre-requisites**
    * Fundamentals of Wireless Communications

**Good to have (but note mandatory): Pre-requisites**
    * Basic idea of 5G-NR standards
    * Python Programming
    * `5G Toolkit <https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/>`_
    * One SDR (We used ADALM-Pluto*)

Here are some excellent references that can be utilized to reinforce and develop the concepts covered in the
aforementioned prerequisites:
