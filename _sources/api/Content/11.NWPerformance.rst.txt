11. Important System Parameters and their effect on the 5G Networks Performance
=================================================================================
*Time: 90 min (video: 15 min + Chapter: 45 min + Code: 30 min)*

In previous chapters we understood the downlink data communication in 5G networks. 5G networks are designed to adapt to
changing conditions and meet the quality of services requirements for diverse use-cases. The primary cetegorization of
user equipment are **e**\nhanced **m**\obile **b**\road **b**\and (eMBB), **u**\ltra-**r**\eliable **l**\ow **l**\atency
**c**\ommunication (uRLLC), and **m**\assive **m**\achine **t**\ype **c**\ommunication (mMTC). However, there many use-cases
which are have intermediate QoS requirements to these use-cases such as vehicle to everything (V2X) networks, extended
reality devices (XR) etc. We will focus primarily on main three use-cases of 5G in this tutorial.

These three use-cases has very different QoS requirements. The eMBB primarily focus on delivering very the data-rate or
network/user-perceived throughput. Whereas, the uRLLC aims to deliver highly reliable communication reacting very quickly
ensured by very low end to end latency. On the other hand, mMTC is designed to serve massive number of devices constrained
in power, complexity and cost which can connect to the network simultaneously requiring small data communications with
clement latency requirements.

This tutorial will introduce the users to some very important physical layer parameters which allows the network meet
the requirements of all these use-cases. We will discuss these parameters in detail and demonstrate how these parameters
influences the network performance. Furthermore, the tutorial will exhibit the fundamental limitations on selection of
these parameters and their dependency of the other system aspects
