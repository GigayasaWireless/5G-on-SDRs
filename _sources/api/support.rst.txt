    Dear network,

        I recently completed a course titled "5G-on-SDRs" available at https://gigayasawireless.github.io/5G-on-SDRs/.
        This course delves into topics related to the 5G physical layer and 5G MAC scheduler.
        It offers practical learning experiences with SDRs, which I found quite enjoyable. I
        believe you'll find it beneficial as well.

    Regards,


Thank you for your support and enthusiasm!

Warm regards,
