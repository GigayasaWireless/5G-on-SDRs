Upcoming versions of this Course
================================

The current version of this course focus on the hardware impairments and mostly downlink aspects of the 5G wireless systems.
The future version of this course will introduce the following aspects of 5G and beyond wireless networks as well. These
topics are listed based on our interests, suggestions from our collaborators and requests from the audience.

Release 23a.1 of GW-H5GSDR
**************************
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning for 5G and Beyond on SDR
* SSB and CSI-RS based Beam-management using SDR

Release 23b of GW-H5GSDR
****************************
* TA estimation and Uplink Synchronization in 5G using SDR
* Emulation of all 5 formats of PUCCH
* PUSCH on SDR
* SRS based CSI acquisition and Uplink beam-management in 5G using SDR
* AI-ML based UE-position estimation using SDRs

Release 24a of GW-H5GSDR
**************************
* Sidelink Synchronization in 5G using SDR
* Emulating physical sidelink control channels (PSCCH) in 5G networks
* Physical sidelink shared channels (PSSCH) for device to device data communication using SDRs
* CSI acquisition and beam-management in 5G-sidelink using SDR
* AI-ML based UE-position estimation using SDRs
* MIMO Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) on SDRs

6G Features
************
These features will be available based on the progress in the development of `5G Toolkit <https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/>`_
and availability of good capability SDRs with me.

* Ambient IoT
* Sensing and Communication
* Sensing and Positioning
* Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
