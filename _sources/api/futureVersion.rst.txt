Upcoming versions of this Course
================================


The current version of this course primarily emphasizes hardware impairments and predominantly covers the downlink
aspects of 5G wireless systems. However, future iterations of this course will expand to incorporate additional aspects
of 5G and beyond wireless networks. These topics are selected based on our interests, suggestions from our collaborators,
and requests from the audience.
